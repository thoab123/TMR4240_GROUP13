Thrust Allocation template

Students should implement an algorithm that maps the desired body-frame
wrench to individual thruster commands. The simulator calls, once per step:

    allocator.allocate(t, dt, tau_d, u_now, alpha_now) -> (u_cmd, alpha_cmd)

Inputs (full actuator state — use what your algorithm needs):
    t         : current simulation time [s]
    dt        : time step [s]              (rate-aware/dynamic allocation)
    tau_d     : (6,) desired BODY wrench [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz]
                (the 3-DOF wrench to allocate is tau_d[[0, 1, 5]]
                 = [Fx, Fy, Mz]; the other components are zero)
    u_now     : current actual thrusts [N]     (rate-aware allocation)
    alpha_now : current thruster angles [rad]  (minimize azimuth slewing)

Outputs:
    u_cmd     : signed thrust command for each thruster [N]
    alpha_cmd : thruster angle command for each thruster [rad]

Students may implement, for example:
    - pseudo-inverse allocation,
    - weighted least-squares allocation,
    - optimization-based allocation,
    - power-minimizing allocation.

Contract with the checks, exactly as the public checks test it: ``allocate()``
must never command more thrust than a thruster can deliver, so for an
infeasible demand (the check uses 400 kN of sway) every |u_cmd| <= u_max.
*How* you handle an infeasible demand beyond that limit is your design
decision, not a checked criterion — state your rule and justify it in the
report.  The check also calls ``allocate()`` repeatedly from the initial
actuator state, applies each command through IDEAL actuators and feeds the
resulting actuator state back as ``u_now``/``alpha_now``; after 30 s of such
calls the achieved wrench must equal the requested one.  A steady-state
allocator therefore passes on its first call; a rate-aware allocator
(optional extension, and optional in the project text too) passes once it has
converged.  In the simulation the transient (thrust ramps, 2 rpm azimuth
slews) is shaped by the actuator model in ``models/thruster_dynamics.py``
whatever you command, so rate limiting your own commands is optional, not
required.  ``u_now``/``alpha_now`` are passed in because a thruster produces
the same force as (u, alpha) or as (-u, alpha + pi): which of the two you
command, and on what basis, is part of your allocation design.
