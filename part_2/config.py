Project Part 2 configuration — all tunable parameters in one place.

Like ``part_1/config.py``, this file belongs to you: put your own
configuration dataclasses here (observer parameters, wave-model settings,
controller gains, ...) so that every Part 2 simulation can be reconfigured
from this file and ``run_case_part_2.py`` without touching the engine.

    uses the field defaults below — so keep your final tuned values as the
    defaults here (overriding them only in ``run_case_part_2.py`` will not
    reach the checks).

class Part2SimConfig:
    """Part 2-only clock and switches; it does not inherit Part 1 settings.

    ``use_sensor_noise`` switches measurement noise on for the optional
    sensor-noise part of the project.  The noise levels are fixed course
    parameters in ``models/sensors.py`` — the switch is the only sensor
    setting you select per simulation.  The mandatory simulations run with
    ideal measurements (``False``, the default).

    ``use_controller=False`` switches the DP system off: the controller is
    not called, the desired wrench is zero and the vessel drifts freely under
    the environmental loads (Simulation 1).  ``use_observer`` still works in
    that mode, so an observer can be watched on a drifting vessel.

    ``dt`` must be 0.1 or 0.01 s (the engine rejects other steps; the Part 1
    default of 0.05 s does not carry over).  ``observer_kwargs`` are passed to
    ``select_observer(observer_type, **observer_kwargs)`` when the engine
    builds the observer, so a differently tuned observer can be selected from
    the configuration (e.g. ``{"cfg": MyObserverConfig(...)}``).
